# Chara's Menu
Chara's Menu is a mod menu for Gorilla Tag, created by me, Chara30678. This menu is designed to be as useful as possible by providing any variety of features and options you would ever need. With Chara's Menu, you can explore new functionalities, experiment with different settings, and enjoy a more personalized modding experience.

## Can I take code from this?
Yes, if you're following the GPL-3.0 license guidelines. If you're interested in using any part of my code, it must be open sourced. You can find my contact information on my [linktree](https://linktr.ee/Chara10163) or in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GXsK5gcFJp). This helps me and you keep the project alive. I'm happy to discuss any potential collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or ideas regarding the code. Come on, [you wouldn't steal a method.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMBqPdMzZ9E)
